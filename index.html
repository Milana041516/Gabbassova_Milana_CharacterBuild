            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Amber Millington is a resident of the House of Anubis and one of Nina's best friends. She is a very girly, sweet, beautiful, naive girl with a flair for fashion and a strong, unbreakable bond with the group. Amber is very fashion forward - she reads dozens of gossip magazines, owns tons of dresses, shoes and jewelry, and decorates her side of her dorm with all things pink. Amber's father is hinted to be a successful business man and very rich, as she shops all the time and in the beginning of the first season, she talks on her phone with her father, saying she wants a bigger allowance because she saw a beautiful pair of shoes. Amber is hinted to be Nina's third-in-command, as she is the only one Nina could trust next to Fabian. Amber would ultimately play a role as not only one of three founding members of the Sibuna Club, but also giving their group its name and membership gesture.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">At the beginning of the second season, she enters a relationship with Alfie Lewis, who had a crush on her. She assists Nina with her quest to find the Mask of Anubis. She reforms Sibuna, even though Nina encourages her not to. Sibuna successfully solves their quest. </p>

            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Patricia Williamson is a resident of Anubis House, a head-strong, witty, goth tomboy who thinks her way out of things and will help her friends out of situations that they can't get out of themselves. At the beginning of the series, after her best friend Joy is removed by the Secret Society who cover up her history in the school, Patricia went to great lengths to find her. Patricia originally believed Nina to be connected to Joy's disappearance, acting vicious, cold, and dark towards her. She met with the mysterious private investigator Dr. Renee Zeldman (later revealed to be Rufus Zeno), who convinces her that he can help find Joy. She joins Sibuna, learning that Anubis House's secret is connected to Joy's disappearance. In the end, she and Nina clear their misunderstandings.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">In the second season, Patricia then rejoined Sibuna to help her friends find the Mask of Anubis, getting marked by the Mark of Anubis prior to her twin sister Piper showing up. Soon Patricia asked Piper to stay, which led to even more drama.</p>

            <p class="lb_text">Nina Martin is an American girl who lived with her grandmother in the United States before moving to Anubis House in England. Nina was the leader of the group Sibuna in the first two seasons. With the help of her friends Fabian and Amber, the three manage to hold all of the other Sibunas together in one piece. She is usually caring, level-headed, clever, and fearless, but is sometimes shy. Nina arrives at Anubis House on a scholarship from the United States on the same day Joy was hidden away by the Secret Society. She obtained a locket from Sarah (under the alias of Emily) prior to beginning her adventures in solving the mystery behind Anubis House. Joined by a few of her roommates, Nina became the leader of the Sibuna club while developing feelings for Fabian. Eventually, as she and Sibuna find the Ankh Pieces after Sarah's passing, Nina learns that she is the actually the Chosen One who can assemble the Cup of Ankh.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">In season two, she is reunited with her friends. She unknowingly lets the spirit Senkhara loose. Senkhara tells Nina that she must find the Mask of Anubis or forfeit her life. She, along with the other Sibuna members, search for the Mask of Anubis in a secret set of tunnels beneath the House of Anubis. Senkhara burns the Mark of Anubis onto Nina's arm. When she finds the Mask of Anubis, she discovers it's missing something: the Frobisher-Smythe gem! At the library, she wears the Mask and almost enters the portal, but Eddie, who is the Osirian, banishes Senkhara from her body.</p>
